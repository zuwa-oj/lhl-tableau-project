# Final-Project-Tableau

## Project/Goals

- Connect to FAA Wildlife Strikes, 2015 dataset and analyse the data
- Build Visualizations in Tableau to show keypoints
- Find trends and interesting patterns within the data
- Create a dashboard to easily answer questions on wildlife strikes


## Process

1. Inspection of datatypes and analysis of dataset
2. Identification of questions that can be answered with the data
3. Development of visualizations to show insights.
4. Identification of trends and interesting patterns within the data
5. Creation of dashboard to answer questions and monitor patterns


## Results

#### Option 2: FAA Wildlife Strikes, 2015

###### Which States have the reported highest occurrences?
The results as seen on the map show that the following states had the highest occurrences of wildlife strikes up to 2015:
- California
- Texas
- Florida
- New York

###### When do wildlife strikes most frequently occur?
The cluster chart shows most wildlife strikes occur during the day, while the least occurrences were recorded at dusk and dawn.

###### What species are involved most frequently?
It can be observed on the tree map that birds are most frequently involved in strikes, with the specific order of Perching birds having the highest recorded number of strikes.

###### Species involved in most expensive damage?
From the bar plots, strikes from the species order of Ducks, Geese, Swans and Waterfowl can be seen to have led to most expensive damages. This is an interesting finding as the expected species would have been Perching birds.

###### Flight phase with most expensive collisions?
The Climb phase of flight was observed to result in the highest costs.
A similar interesting finding was observed where the Approach and Landing Roll flight phases during which most strikes happen, do not account for the most expensive damages.


## Challenges 

- Identification of questions that could be useful for mitigation of wildlife strikes.


## Future Goals

- Building more visualizations
- Using the Tableau Story feature for presentation of results
- Integrating flight path data to increase understanding of strike patterns.
